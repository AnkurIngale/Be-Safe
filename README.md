Basic features to be implemented:

1. News feed that would make people aware of the threats about to come. The latest news feed will be saved in user's device just in case he/she could not access the internet thereafter.

2. A user login portal that would collect information from the user so that they can be informed in the event of disaster.

3. Database: we will create a database of the threats emminent in different areas in the state of Assam.

4. Data would be collected from an external API. We would also ask our users to give their inputs which would help in faster news delivery to other users.

5. We will add a volunteer section wherein if any user wants to volunteer in case of a disaster, his/her contact details will be made public to all other users.

6. We will be implementing a dashboard wherein the user can get emergency contacts, whatsapp group invite links, donation and money drive links etc.

7. We will also mail and send a sms to the user in case a disaster took/will take place.

Features to be implemented if time permits:

1. Interactive map displaying the exact location of the disaster.

2. Expanding the region from Assam to other states of the country.

3. Taking data related to disasters from users and filtering it alongwith API data.
